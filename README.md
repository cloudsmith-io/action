# Cloudsmith Push Action

Push packages easily to your [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com) repositories, using the [Cloudsmith CLI](https://pypi.org/project/cloudsmith-cli/).

## Cloudsmith CLI and Executable

This action now supports both the Cloudsmith CLI and the new Cloudsmith executable. The Cloudsmith executable allows you to use Cloudsmith without needing to install it via pip, making it easier to integrate into your workflows.

From v0.6.9, we default the action to use the executable instead of having to install python, if you wish to use the old workflow, you can do so by specifying `executable: "false"`. This will attempt to download python and use pip to install the Cloudsmith-cli instead.

```yaml
...
      - name: Push
        id: push
        uses: cloudsmith-io/action@master
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY }}
          command: "push"
          format: "maven"

          republish: "true"
          file: "test/fixture/cloudsmith-maven-example-1.0.0.jar"
          executable: "false" # Add this to use pip instead

## Cloudsmith API Key

The API key is required for the cloudsmith-cli to work.

Obtain the API Key from [Cloudsmith user settings](https://cloudsmith.io/user/settings/api/). You should use a least-privilege account for Continuous Integration.

Add a secret named `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY` and a value of the API Key obtained from cloudsmith. Secrets are maintained in the settings of each repository.

Pass your secret to the Action as seen in the Example usage.

## Examples

The following examples use static files located within `test/fixtures`. When republishing existing packages the `republish` flag must be set to `true`, but is otherwise recommended to not use this since it overwrites (and causes longer publish times).

To pin to a specific release of this Github Action, replace `use: cloudsmith-io/action@master` with the version you require e.g. `uses: cloudsmith-io/action@0.4.0`.

You can also add "tags" to your upload process by specifying `tags` in your workflow, this is a comma separated string. (Some special characters like `:` are not allowed).
